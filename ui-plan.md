# UI Component Plan for LMS Project

## Overview
This plan outlines the reusable and page-level components for the Learning Management System (LMS) to ensure a scalable, intuitive, and consistent user interface. The structure leverages Next.js with Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and modularity.

## Reusable Components
1. **Navbar**
   - Purpose: Top navigation bar with links (e.g., Home, Dashboard, Login/Logout).
   - Location: `components/Navbar.js`
   - Features: Responsive collapse for mobile, consistent branding.
2. **Footer**
   - Purpose: Bottom section with links (e.g., About, Contact) and copyright.
   - Location: `components/Footer.js`
   - Features: Fixed or static positioning, responsive layout.
3. **Button**
   - Purpose: Standardized button styles for actions (e.g., Sign In, Enroll).
   - Location: `components/Button.js`
   - Features: Variants (primary, secondary), hover states, responsive sizing.
4. **Input**
   - Purpose: Form input fields (e.g., email, password).
   - Location: `components/Input.js`
   - Features: Labels, error states, responsive widths.
5. **CourseCard**
   - Purpose: Display individual course details and progress.
   - Location: `components/CourseCard.js`
   - Features: Thumbnail, title, progress bar, responsive grid layout.

## Page-Level Components
1. **SignInPage**
   - Purpose: Login page for user authentication.
   - Location: `app/signin/page.js`
   - Layout: Centered form with `Input` and `Button` components.
2. **DashboardLayout**
   - Purpose: Container for the dashboard with `Navbar` and main content.
   - Location: `app/dashboard/layout.js`
   - Layout: Header with `Navbar`, main section, and optional `Footer`.
3. **AdminDashboard**
   - Purpose: Admin-specific dashboard for managing courses and users.
   - Location: `app/admin/dashboard/page.js`
   - Layout: Sidebar navigation, main content area with `CourseCard`.

## Folder Structure
- `app/`: Contains page-level components and layouts.
  - `signin/`: Login page files.
  - `dashboard/`: Dashboard layout and pages.
  - `admin/dashboard/`: Admin-specific dashboard.
- `components/`: Reusable UI components.
  - `Navbar.js`, `Footer.js`, `Button.js`, `Input.js`, `CourseCard.js`.
- `public/`: Static assets (e.g., icons, images).
- `styles/`: Global styles (e.g., `globals.css` with Tailwind).

## Responsiveness
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) for breakpoints.
- Ensure components adapt to mobile (up to 640px), tablet (641px-1024px), and desktop (1025px+).
- Test layouts with browser dev tools or local server.

## Next Steps
- Implement skeleton components with basic HTML and Tailwind styling.
- Validate structure with local run (`npm run dev`).
- Iterate based on feedback or additional requirements.
